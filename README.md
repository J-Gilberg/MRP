Having some fun with Statistics and Linear Algebra! Woo!!

This is the start of a project I really wanted to build in my previous supply chain management roles to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of demand and supply planning. 

Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is the process of determing how much of something you need to accomplish your goal. 
This system is build for direct/indirect physical goods distribution or usage. 

Tech:
- Primary Language: JavaScript
- Frontend: React, MVC framework
- Backend: Express, MySQL
- Testing: Mocha

MVP:
- setup a SQL database to store and control data. 
- implement Cubic Regression Model from scratch (without using existing libraries)
    - use Gauss-Jordan method to calculate inverse of the matrix.
    - a model will be generated per item.
- a forecast for the items will be generated by the model
- buying recommendations will be determined based of the forecast and users parameters.

Addional features:
- Want to all the user to be able to manually modify the outputs and recommendations.
- The user should be able to save their purchasing plan and turn it into actual purchases.
- Add Multiple Regression.


******************************REACT APP STUFF******************************
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
